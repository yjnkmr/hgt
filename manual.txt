HGT detection program, version 0.9


1) -------- Prerequisites --------

  OS: UNIX/Linux
  Compiler: GCC (A specific version of GLIBCXX might be required.)



2) -------- Installation from the source code --------

  Precompiled programs are already in bin directory, you can use those.
  If you want to build those from source codes, move to src directory, 
  and edit Makefile if necessary. Then, do "make".

    $ make
    $ make install

  Then, add the path to bin directory to your PATH environment variable.
  

3) -------- Usage --------

  3-1) Construction of Markov model

    Command: 

      $ markov C 6 3 3 -t trans.txt -e emit.txt INPUT
  
    INPUT is your CDS file in multi-FASTA format. This command will output two files, 
    trans.txt and emit.txt.


  3-2) Computation of HGT index (I index)

    Command:

      $ predict INPUT 6 3 -u trans.txt emit.txt > OUTPUT 

    INPUT, trans.txt and emit.txt are the same as above. The result will be  
    written into OUTPUT in which the 7th column is I index.
 

  3-3) Example

    There are sample data in example directory, these were output by the
    following commands:

      $ markov C 6 3 3 -t trans.txt -e emit.txt ecoli_cds.fasta
      $ predict ecoli_cds.fasta 6 3 -u trans.txt emit.txt > ecoli_cds.out.txt


  ##### Caution in ver 0.9 #####
  This program is originally developed for hidden Markov modeling and has 
  other options for it, but those are under construction. Therefore, use of
  the options not shown above is UNRECOMMENDED so far (in ver 0.9).
